# -A-Study-About-CNN-s-using-MNIST-Dataset

Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a deep learning architecture widely used in image and video
recognition, processing, and analysis. In this assignment, I explore the fundamentals of CNN by
building a basic model and applying different techniques to enhance its performance.
For the assignment, I created several (a total of 10) models to evaluate the performance of CNN in
the MNIST dataset. The models differ in the case of kernel size, order of the layers, batch size,
learning rate, and activation function
